# Description

This Python script allows users to automatically clone multiple GitHub repositories provided in a text file. It specifically caters to the use case where you have a list of GitHub URLs for Nuclei templates and you want to clone all of them in a directory.

Nuclei is a project that allows you to customize scanning for specific vulnerabilities, and these templates are the definitions of those specific vulnerabilities. This script helps in automating the process of getting those templates.

# Installation

# Prerequisites

* Python 3.6 or newer: You can download it from the official Python website.
* GitPython package: You can install it via pip with the following command in your terminal:

  pip install GitPython

* Git: This script uses git commands to clone repositories. If you haven't installed git yet, you can download it from the official Git website.

# Execution Instructions

* Copy the Python code and save it as a Python file (for example, clone_nuclei_templates.py).
* Prepare a text file that contains the list of GitHub repository URLs you want to clone. Each URL should be on a new line. Save this file as nuclei.txt in the same directory as your Python script.
* Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where your Python script and nuclei.txt file are located.
* Run the Python script using the following command:

  python clone_nuclei_templates.py

The script will then clone each repository listed in the nuclei.txt file into a directory called nuclei_templates. If the nuclei_templates directory does not exist, the script will create it. If an error occurs while cloning a particular repository, the script will skip it and move to the next one, and the error will be printed to the console.

After the script finishes running, you should find your cloned repositories in the nuclei_templates directory.
